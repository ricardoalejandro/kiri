# AI Project Handover - Kiri CRM

## 1. Project Overview

**Kiri CRM** is a multi-tenant SaaS CRM focused on WhatsApp operations, sales workflows, leads, contacts, tasks, bots and automations. It includes role-based access control, subscriptions, integrations and a Next.js dashboard.

Current implementation notes:
- WhatsApp Web integration uses **whatsmeow**, not Baileys.
- Database access uses **pgx**, not Gorm.
- Backend entrypoint is `backend/cmd/server/main.go`.
- Main API route registration is in `backend/internal/api/server.go`.

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React, Zustand.
- **Backend**: Go 1.24, Fiber, pgx, PostgreSQL, Redis.
- **Storage**: MinIO/S3-compatible media storage.
- **Realtime**: WebSocket hub at `/ws`.
- **Integrations**: Google Contacts and WhatsApp Cloud API.
- **AI**: Eros assistant endpoints.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, backend, frontend and Traefik labels for production routing.

## 3. Product Surface

## 6. Repository State Guidance

If the repo is dirty, treat it as active work until proven otherwise. Do not revert broad changes automatically.

Recommended triage:
1. Use `git status --short` and `git diff --stat` to classify changes by feature area.
2. Review any changed file before editing it.
3. Keep documentation fixes, frontend work, backend work and deploy changes in separate commits when possible.
4. Only discard changes with an explicit decision from the project owner.

Current observed dirty areas include backend API/domain/repository/service/storage/WhatsApp, Docker config, frontend dashboard/layout/settings/landing/chat, login/signup, storage UI, sitemap/robots and Playwright tests.

## 7. Security Note

Do not store real credentials in this handover. Use `.env.example` for placeholder values and keep production secrets in deployment-managed environment variables.
